# Semi-supervised
Aim of this task is to use unsupervised learning as a preliminary step to supervised learning . In case of huge unlabelled dataset it is a difficult task to label all data points and then perform any supervised learning task. So we here intelligently choose 40% of the data points using k-means clustering  and we see that we can achieve an acceptable accuracy of around 80% which is 4% less than when we use the whole dataset. This concept was learned though o'reilly book .I tried this concept on CIFAR10 and Fashion dataset but CIFAR did not perform well because it has non linearly separable points which could be done efficiently by neural networks but here I have used Linear SVC hence only the Fashion dataset was used.
